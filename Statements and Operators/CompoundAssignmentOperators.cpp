    Operator                Example                   Meaning

    --------------------- Mathematical Operators----------------------  NOTE: Used for maths

    +=                      lhs += rhs;               lhs = lhs + (rhs)
    -=                      lhs -= rhs;               lhs = lhs - (rhs)
    *=                      lhs *= rhs;               lhs = lhs * (rhs)  I.e. Multiply lhs by rhs and store product in lhs
    /=                      lhs /= rhs;               lhs = lhs / (rhs)  I.e. Devide lhs by rhs and store product in lhs
    %=                      lhs %= rhs;               lhs = lhs % (rhs)

    --------------------- Bit-wise Operators-------------------------- NOTE: Used to manipulate Bits

    >>=                     lhs >>= rhs;              lhs = lhs >> (rhs)
    <<=                     lhs <<= rhs;              lhs = lhs << (rhs)
    &=                      lhs &= rhs;               lhs = lhs & (rhs)
    ^=                      lhs ^= rhs;               lhs = lhs ^ (rhs)
    |=                      lhs |= rhs;               lhs = lhs | (rhs)
