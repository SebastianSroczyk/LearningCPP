/*

    Procedural Programming

        - Focus is on process or actions a program takes.
        - Programs are typically a collection of functions.
        - Data is declared separatly.
        - Data is passed as arguments into fucntions.
        - Fairly Easy to learn.

    Procedural Programming Limitations

        - Functions need to know the structure of the data.
            I.e. If the structure of the data changes many functions will need to be changed.

        - As the program gets larger it becomes:
            Difficult to understand.
            Harder to maintain.
            Difficult to extend.
            Difficult to Debug.
            Difficult to reuse code.
            Fragile and easy to break.

    Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

        - Focus is on Classes; that model the real-world domain entities
        - Allows developers to think at a higher level of abstraction
        - Used successfully in larger programs.
        - Reusability of code.

    4 Pillers of OOP:

        Encapsulation:
            - Objects contain the data AND operations that use the data
            - Abstract Data Type (ADT)
        
        Abstraction:
            - Implementation-specific logic can be hidden
            - User of the class code only interacts with the interface provided and doesn't need to know the code.
            - More Abstraction
            - Easier to test, debug, maintain and extend.

        Polymorthism:
            - Allows classes to create different variations of the same object

        Inheritance:
            - Allows the creation of a class based on an existing class,
              which inherits the parents classes data and functions.
    
    Limitations of Object Oriented Programming:

        NOT a panacea
            - OOP will NOT make bad code better
            - It is NOT suitable for all types of problems
            - Not everything decomposes into a class
        
        Learning Curve.
