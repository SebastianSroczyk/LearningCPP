List initialization does not allow narrowing (Â§iso.8.5.4). That is:

- An integer cannot be converted to another integer that cannot hold its value. For example, char to int is allowed, but not int to char.
- A floating-point value cannot be converted to another floating-point type that cannot hold its value. For example, float to double is allowed, but not double to float.
- A floating-point value cannot be converted to an integer type.
- An integer value cannot be converted to a floating-point type.
